# Misty
> Misty is a rotation addon for World of Warcraft which utilizes the power of an advanced lua unlocker to automate the gameplay of the player.  

## This is a personal project
> It's not meant to be anything more, if you use it and make your own rotations then great for you but I do not expect you to use or create anything in this addon, it's purely for my own educational objective.  

### Legal version?
> There may be a "legal" version of this addon which overlays the spells you should cast and auto targets the player the spell is best casted upon at any given time, but it will require a little bit of effort on my part as many of the current hooks utilize some kind of protected lua function.  It is possible but will not be any time soon, I would rather finish the "illegal" version first.  

#### If you use this rotation addon I'm not responsible for whatever it causes.  
> The use of a software to automate any player actions in game is against the blizzard Terms of Service, and can lead to your account being banned.
