Single Target Healing

Renewing Mist
maintain to get vivify proc

Enveloping Mist
keep on tank

Vivify
always use when proc is up from renewing mist

Effuse
small amounts of damage use this

 
Multi-Targets

Vivify
use when group is taking damage

Essence Font
I choose to ignore this in mythic/+ and mainly use for raiding, mana drain is too much.  Prehaps if group health is all bellow 30% we can make an exception

Zen Pulse/Chi Burst
Basically use on cooldown
